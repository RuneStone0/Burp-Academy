1) SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft  will not get solved using this `'+UNION+SELECT+@@version,NULL%23asdasd`

2) Feature Request: NoSQL Labs

3) The lab `Blind SQL injection with time delays` works for all 4 DBMS types which is somewhat unrealistic. Perhaps it should just work with one?

4) When viewing a lab from the built-in chrome browser the page doesn't load properly.
