# Burp Academy Solutions
My solutions for the Burp Academy labs.

# Feedback to PortSwigger
* Add unique IDs for each lab, so its easier to reference a specific lab. Currently, the only unique identifier is the lab title (e.g. `Blind SQL injection with time delays`)
* Add NoSQL Labs
* SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft  will not get solved using this `'+UNION+SELECT+@@version,NULL%23asdasd`
* The lab `Blind SQL injection with time delays` works for all 4 DBMS types which is somewhat unrealistic. Perhaps it should just work with one?
* When viewing a lab from the built-in chrome browser the page doesn't load properly.
* Add Open Redirect labs
